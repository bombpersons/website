title: "What? A third post!?"

That's right, a 3rd post? Who would believe it.

## Things I'm going to do with this site

### Games
If I ever muster up the motivation to create any sort of games (I'm interested in learning [Godot](http://godotengine.org)) then I'll put them somewhere on this site I suppose. I was messing about with it a while back and made [this](/assets/games/angel_game/index.html) as a test.

### Movie / Game reviews
Following in [my girlfriend's](https://rena.talkhaus.com/reviews/) footsteps I might write down some thoughts on the films we watch. Might be interesting to see how our opinions differ.

### Plants and Veg
Exciting posts about home grown veg! Probably including progress pictures of the garden and perhaps reviews of the different varieties we are growing.

### Recipes
If any of my cooking experiments go well (or not) perhaps I'll post those?
